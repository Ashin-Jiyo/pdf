# Dynamic PDF Library & Content Hub

üåü **Live Demo**: [https://ashin-jiyo.github.io/pdf-library-hub/](https://ashin-jiyo.github.io/pdf-library-hub/)

A comprehensive React-based web application for managing and sharing PDF documents with advanced features including full-text search, user comments, analytics, and role-based administration.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Public PDF Display**: Clean, responsive interface to showcase PDF documents
- **Direct Access**: View PDFs in new tabs and download with one click
- **Secure Dashboard**: Role-based access for admin and root users
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete PDF management system

### Advanced Features
- **Full-Text Search**: Search within PDF content using Algolia
- **Categories & Tags**: Organize PDFs with flexible categorization
- **User Comments**: Community feedback and interaction system
- **Analytics**: Track views, downloads, and user engagement
- **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts for new uploads
- **Rich Text Descriptions**: Enhanced content descriptions with formatting
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Intuitive file upload experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions)
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **File Storage**: Dual system - Cloudinary + ImageKit
- **Search**: Algolia (planned)
- **Email**: SendGrid/Mailgun (planned)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast

## üíæ Smart File Storage System

This application uses an intelligent dual upload system that automatically routes files to the most appropriate storage service:

### File Size Routing
- **PDFs < 10MB**: Uploaded to **Cloudinary** (fast, cost-effective)
- **PDFs 10MB - 25MB**: Uploaded to **ImageKit** (optimized for larger files)
- **PDFs > 25MB**: Rejected with helpful error message

### Why Two Services?
- **Cost Optimization**: Maximizes free tier limits across services
- **Performance**: Each service optimized for different file sizes
- **Reliability**: Redundancy across multiple CDN providers
- **Scalability**: Easy to adjust routing logic based on usage

### Setup Requirements
- **Cloudinary Account**: For files < 10MB ([Setup Guide](./CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md))
- **ImageKit Account**: For files 10MB-25MB ([Setup Guide](./IMAGEKIT_SETUP.md))
- **Automatic Detection**: System shows which service will be used before upload
