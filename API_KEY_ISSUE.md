# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Resend API Key Configuration

## Issue Found: Restricted API Key

Your current Resend API key is **restricted to sending emails only** and cannot create audiences. This is a common security setting.

## ✅ **Quick Fix Options:**

### **Option 1: Use Manual Audience ID (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/audiences
2. **Create Audience Manually**:
   - Click "Create Audience"
   - Name: "PDF Library Hub Subscribers"
   - Copy the Audience ID (looks like: `aud_xxx...`)

3. **Add to your API .env file**:
   ```env
   RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=aud_your_audience_id_here
   ```

4. **Restart API server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   # Then restart:
   npm run api
   ```

### **Option 2: Create Unrestricted API Key**

1. **Go to Resend API Keys**: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. **Create new API key** with full permissions (not just sending)
3. **Update API .env file**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=re_your_new_full_access_key
   ```
4. **Restart API server**

## 🧪 **Test After Setup:**

Once you have the audience ID configured:

```bash
# Test creating a contact
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/create-contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User"}'

# Should return: {"success":true,"message":"Contact created successfully"}
```

## 📧 **Current System Status:**
