# ✅ Dual ImageKit Setup Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 🔄 Smart File Routing System
- **Files < 10MB** → ImageKit Small Account
- **Files 10-25MB** → ImageKit Main Account
- **Automatic routing** based on file size

### 🛠️ New Services Created

1. **`imagekitDualService.ts`**
   - Handles smart routing between accounts
   - Separate upload methods for each account
   - Provider-specific file naming and folders

2. **Updated `imagekitAuth.ts`**
   - Added `getImageKitSmallAuthParams()` function
   - Supports authentication for both accounts

3. **Enhanced `pdfUploadService.ts`**
   - Uses dual service for all uploads
   - Updated type system for new providers
   - Better deletion handling

### 📊 Database Schema Updates
- New provider types: `imagekit-small`, `imagekit-large`
- Backward compatibility with existing `imagekit` entries
- Provider-specific metadata storage

### 🧪 Testing Tools
- **ImageKit Test Tool**: Test uploads to both accounts
- **Health Check Tool**: Monitor both account usages
- **Migration Page**: Combined management interface

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

### 1. Create Second ImageKit Account
```bash
# Visit: https://imagekit.io/
# Sign up with different email
# Choose unique account ID (e.g., pdfbps-small)
# Get API credentials
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Small Account Credentials (NEW)
VITE_IMAGEKIT_SMALL_PUBLIC_KEY=your_small_public_key
VITE_IMAGEKIT_SMALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_small_private_key  
VITE_IMAGEKIT_SMALL_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your_small_id/
```

### 3. Test the System
1. **Restart development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Go to migration page**: `/pdf-migration` (or create route)
3. **Use test tool** to upload files of different sizes
4. **Verify routing** in both ImageKit dashboards

## 📈 Benefits You'll Get

### Doubled Quotas
- **Before**: 20GB bandwidth/month
- **After**: 40GB bandwidth/month (20GB × 2 accounts)

### Better Organization
- **Small Account**: Quick uploads, documents, forms
- **Main Account**: Large presentations, detailed reports

### Performance Benefits
- **Load Distribution**: Spread uploads across accounts
- **Parallel Processing**: Both accounts work simultaneously
- **Reduced Contention**: No single account bottleneck

### Monitoring Advantages
- **Separate Dashboards**: Monitor each account independently
- **Usage Tracking**: See which file sizes are most common
- **Cost Planning**: Better understanding of storage patterns

## 🔧 File Organization

### Small Account Structure:
```
/pdf-library/small-pdfs/
├── small_1754416001_document1.pdf
├── small_1754416002_form.pdf
└── small_1754416003_memo.pdf
```

### Main Account Structure:
```
/pdf-library/large-pdfs/
├── large_1754416004_presentation.pdf
├── large_1754416005_manual.pdf
└── large_1754416006_report.pdf
```

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### Test Small Files (< 10MB):
- Upload a small PDF
- Check it goes to small account
- Verify folder: `/pdf-library/small-pdfs/`
- Confirm prefix: `small_timestamp_`

### Test Large Files (≥ 10MB):
- Upload a large PDF
- Check it goes to main account  
- Verify folder: `/pdf-library/large-pdfs/`
- Confirm prefix: `large_timestamp_`

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Application Logs:
```javascript
// Upload logs show routing decisions
"Uploading file: document.pdf (5.2MB)"
"Using ImageKit small account for file < 10MB" 
"PDF uploaded successfully to ImageKit small account"
```

### Database Tracking:
```javascript
// New provider values in database
uploadProvider: "imagekit-small"  // or "imagekit-large"
imagekitFileId: "file_id_from_respective_account"
```

### Dashboard Monitoring:
- **Small Account Dashboard**: Track < 10MB usage
- **Main Account Dashboard**: Track ≥ 10MB usage
- **Combined View**: Application's migration page

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues:

1. **Missing Small Account Credentials**
   ```bash
   Error: ImageKit small account private key not found
   # Solution: Add VITE_IMAGEKIT_SMALL_* variables to .env
   ```

2. **Files Going to Wrong Account**
   ```bash
   # Check file size detection in browser console
   # Verify 10MB threshold (10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
   ```

3. **Authentication Errors**
   ```bash
   # Verify API keys are correct
   # Check for extra spaces in .env variables
   # Restart development server
   ```
